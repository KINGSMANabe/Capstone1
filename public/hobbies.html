    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>When I was younger my hobby was to draw. I always draw and mimic animes, characters from games or creative drawings
       but when I started growing up I shifted into playing badminton, basketball and other outdoor activities. I remember during those days since 
       internet is not as interactive like today where there was no social medias that can be access by young ones and the 
       the primary simple enjoyment of young ones like my self are physical activities like outdoor games under the 
       sun(oh I love those days) I was always so excited to go home from school to play basketball with my friends sometimes badminton 
       or any outdoor activities. Nowadays, my main hobbies(I miss my old self, SAD) are watching series, animes, playing games(offline/online) and most of 
       the time listening to music while being productive. Im also trying to make coding a hobby(finger crossed hehe).
