    <h3>Summary :</h3>
      <p>I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology 22nd of September year 2022. I have been looking for an entry level position for Web Development ever since but as of now 
         I am not fortunate to secure an interview for this field. I have fundamental knowledge with front-end development prior to my internship. In order to achieve my goal to be
         a web developer, I am currently undergoing into a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp to upskill and familiarize my self wih the technologies required to be confident enough 
         in acing up interviews and secure an entry level position in Web Development. </p>
